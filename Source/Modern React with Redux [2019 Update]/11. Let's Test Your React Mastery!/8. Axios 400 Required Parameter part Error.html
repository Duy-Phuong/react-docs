<p>In the upcoming lecture we will be creating an axios instance with default values to call the YouTube API with. As of today (5/30/2019), the axios library released v0.19.0 which seems to have included a bug that was never resolved in the beta version. This will cause a 400 error failure with the message "Required Parameter : part"</p><p>The get around this and follow along with the course, do the following:</p><p><code>npm uninstall axios</code></p><p><code>npm install axios@0.18.0</code></p><p>The issue appears to only revolve around the params object so the other projects we have created or will create in the future will not be affected.</p>
