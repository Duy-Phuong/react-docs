<p>This section is based on <em>old</em> versions of React Router and Redux Form.  You can ignore this section if you do not want to learn how to use an older version of React Router and Redux Form (so you probably should skip this).</p><p>The older videos are being left on this course because many, many people work on projects using these earlier versions.  These engineers use this set of videos for training new employees on the older versions.</p>
