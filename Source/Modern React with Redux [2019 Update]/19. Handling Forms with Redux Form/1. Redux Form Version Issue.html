<p>As of March 22 2019, the maintainer of Redux Form seems to have accidentally rolled back to an extremely out of date version:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/releases</a></p><p>To work around this, we need to install a specific version which is the latest known good release:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">npm install redux-form@8.1.0</pre><p>If you already have Redux Form installed you may also have to delete your node_modules and package-lock.json file and re-run <code>npm install</code> after changing to v8.1.0 in your package.json file.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There are many bugs in Redux Form v8.2.0 so for now we would still suggest using the above mentioned version.</p>
