<p>Now that we've looked at a couple different app layouts, we are going to start working on our next app.  You'll need to set up a new copy of the Redux Simple Starter package.  Go back to the GitHub repository - <a href="https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter</a>,  and either clone or download the repository.  Remember, after you download the package you'll need to run <code>npm install</code> in the project directory.</p>
