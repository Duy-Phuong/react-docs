<p><strong>Oops!  Mistake on my part ahead!  </strong></p>

<p>In the next video, I tell you to run the command <code>npm install --save react-router@4.0.0</code> .</p>

<p>The React Router project has now been broken up into a couple of different libraries.  The <strong>correct</strong> command to run is <code>npm install --save react-router-dom@4.2.2</code> <strong>&lt;--run this instead</strong>.  This library contains the flavor of react-router related to working with the DOM, as opposed to other platforms (like React Native).</p>
